<h2 class="sectionedit22" id="common_secure_design_issues">Common Secure Design Issues</h2>
<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <b>Poor Use of Cryptography:</b></div>
<ul>
<li class="level4 node"><div class="li"> Cryptography is an essential technique for creating secure systems. When two parties communicate over an insecure channel such as the Internet and eavesdropping is a threat, cryptography can be used to mitigate that threat. Five common pitfalls:</div>
<ol>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> Creating Your Own Cryptography</div>
</li>
<li class="level6 node"><div class="li"> Choosing the Wrong Cryptography: In general, using FIPS-approved algorithms is a good idea. The two major types of cryptography are symmetric and public key. Within symmetric are block ciphers and stream ciphers. Block ciphers require you to select a mode of operation. Public key cryptography allows both the sender and receiver to have their own key.</div>
<ul>
<li class="level8"><div class="li"> Cryptographic hash functions and message authentication codes are better suited for security mechanisms to detect tampering or to sign a message.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level6"><div class="li"> Relying on Security by Obscurity: Security by obscurity is a tempting thing for programmers to rely on. It works only if no one tries hard enough to break through the security. The problem is that the length of time is under the attacker&#039;s control.</div>
</li>
<li class="level6 node"><div class="li"> Hard-Coded Secrets: </div>
<ul>
<li class="level8"><div class="li"> One of the fundamental tenants of cryptography is that secrets must remain secret, or the crypto system fails to work. What  good is a password if you write it down and post it on the outside of your laptop?</div>
</li>
<li class="level8"><div class="li"> Many programs have a requirement that data must be stored securely on disk or in a database.</div>
</li>
<li class="level8"><div class="li"> Building crypto-systems is difficult. Key management is the process of installing and moving around the secret keys that make the crypto-system work. Programmers often miss this critical factor or just don&#039;t have enough time to do it right. A good rule of thumb is that if you have a hard-coded secret key in your application, you need to treat the entire application as a secret. A type of cryptography called public key cryptography uses public keys that can be widely distributed.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level6 node"><div class="li"> Mishandling Private Information: </div>
<ul>
<li class="level8"><div class="li">  Private information is data that the application should not disclose to anyone but users authorized to access it. Secrets such as passwords, password hashes, crypto keys, account names, credit card numbers, and account balances, often is very important to keep private. You should review the value of the system&#039;s data assets and design the system such that other valuable information is not disclosed.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li > Tracking Users and Their Permissions:  Many networked applications need to track which user is associated with a transaction so that the application can perform an authorization step before the transaction will complete.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li > <strong>Weak Structural Security:</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Large Attack Surface: The attack surface is the boundary of an application that an attacker can potentially interact with. An application listening to the network on two ports is typical less secure than an application listening on one.</div>
</li>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Running a Process at a too High Privilege Level: When a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker&#039;s actions, whether executing arbitrary code or manipulating the system&#039;s file system, are performed with the privileges of the running process. Running at the lowest possible privilege level to accomplish what the software needs limits the damage caused if a vulnerability is exploited.</div>
</li>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> No Defense in Depth: A fundamental tenant of secure design is to not rely on one mechanism to achieve security because that mechanism may fail. Multiple independent security mechanisms should be employed. A real-world example of defense in depth is a bank&#039;s physical security. When designing mitigations against threats to an application, designers should use multiple mechanisms to counter the threat. </div>
</li>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Not Failing Securely: A major source of unintended functionality is error handling code. It is often inadequately designed and tested. Often error messages contain stack traces, directory information, and version information for software components and services the software connects to.</div>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> <strong>Other Design Flaws:</strong></div>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Mixing Code and Data: Multi-tier applications often transfer commands and other interpreted code from one process to another. If an attacker can find a way to modify this code, he will have found a way to modify the application's execution. The application design should isolate the data supplied by users from the code that the application transmits to other systems or executes itself.</div>
</li>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Misplaced Trust in External Systems: Every data input into an application is a potential hazard. It is often obvious to software designers that they need to be worry of the data input by users. The data is useful for logging, but an attacker should not be able to leverage control of an external server to get an application to make a different security decision.</div>
</li>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Insecure Defaults: An application should always default to a secure operating mode. It should not require a configuration change out of the box to be made secure because this change will often be forgotten or performed improperly. Attackers target insecure default configurations because they know many systems are deployed that way.</div>
</li>
<li class="level11"><div class="li"> Missing Audit Logs: Audit logs are an essential component of a secure application. They enable attacks to be detected.</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit23" id="programming_language_implementation_issues">Programming Language Implementation Issues</h2>
<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li > Every programming language has idiosyncrasies that, if not understood and 
dealt with during the coding process, can lead to security flaws. The programmer must avoid using some elements of a programming language or its programming environment to avoid creating implementation flaws. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>1. Compiled language: C/C++</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li > The C language was designed to be low-level and portable Many applications are written in C and C++ for the increased performance of low-level portable languages on these operating systems where the native interfaces are also written in C.
</li>
<li class="level20"><div class="li"> This causes a problem because the C language has historically had the most security-related issues of any programming language. </div>
</li>
<li class="level20"><div class="li">One of security problems is that C Language Has No Safe Native String Type and No Safe Easy-to-Use String-Handling Functions.</div>
</li>
<li class="level20"><div class="li">In C, strings are arrays of characters with a NULL terminator signifying the end of the string. The following string is represented in memory as shown in the following figure :</div>
</li>
</ul>


<kbd>char buffer[]  = "small string"; </kbd> <br/>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="../../img/memory.png" class="media" title="memory.png"><img src="../../img/memory.png" class="mediacenter" alt="" width="300" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li > Nowhere is the string&#039;s size actually stored. It is up to the programmer to manage the size. If the programmer gets lazy and doesn&#039;t keep track of the size or makes mistake with the size, this can lead to memory beyond the end of buffer being overwritten when the string is copied. This situation is called a buffer overrun.
</li>
<li > A class of string-handling function takes no size value as a parameter. These functions include strcpy and strcat. These are called unbounded string function. They copy and concentrate a source buffer to a target buffer one character a time until the terminating NULL is reached. If the source is larger than the target, you get a buffer overrun.
</li>
<li > Example of problematic usage:
</li>
</ul>

<code>
      int check_login( char  *name) <br/>
 { <br/>
int x  =	0;  <br/>
char small_buffer[10]; <br/>


if	(strcmp(name,  "admin")	==	0) <br/>
x	=	1	;  <br/>


strcpy(small_buffer, name); <br/>


return x; <br/>

}
</code>
<ul>
<li > In this example, the user inputs the variable name. If the programmer allows the user to enter any size of string, the user might enter a value longer than nine characters and end up overflowing the small_buffer variable when the strcpy function is called. When this happens, the memory after the small_buffer is overwritten with the content of name that is longer than nine characters.
</li>
<li > small_buffer is a local variable to this function, Directly after small_buffer is an integer variable, x This variable gets overwritten when small_buffer is overrun, see the following figure :
</li>
</ul>

after
<a href="../../img/memory3.png" class="media" title="memory3.png"><img src="../../img/memory3.png" class="media" alt="" width="300" /></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li > Another common way that buffers get overrun in C is with the <strong>sprintf</strong> function. This function takes parameters specifying a target buffer, a format string, and a variable number of source buffers:</div>
</li>
</ul>

<code>
   sprintf (target, format, sourcel, source2,....,sourcen);
</code>

<ul>
<li> The format is made up of static text and format specifiers. A %s format specifier is used for a string, and a %d format specifier is used for an integer. A typical format string looks like 
"Name: %s, count:  %d"
</li>
<li><strong>problem: Buffer Overruns Can Overrun Function Return Addresses on the Stack.</strong>
</li>
<li> The problem is that The return address that is used to return to the location from where a function is called resides on the stack right after the local variables. The return address is a hidden piece of data that resides on the stack with the rest of the variables passed to a function. Compiled programs place this data on the stack before calling the function.
</li>
<li> For example, consider the following C/C++ code:</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="../../img/code2.png" class="media" title="code2.png"><img src="../../img/code2.png" class="media" alt="" width="300" /></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li> This C++ code simply takes the supplied first and last names and puts them together, separated by a space. Of particular importance is the fullName variable. The way it is declared causes it to reside on the stack. The problem is that this variable can easily exceed 1,024 characters whenever firstName or lastName or both values are too long.
</li>
<li> The combination of buffer overruns and overwriting the function return address causes C to be one of the most insecure languages of all time. These two issues lead to the most common critical security flaw, in which the attacker can execute arbitrary code of his choosing.</li>
<li> <strong>Solution</strong>
</li>
<li> Preventing buffer overflows consists mainly of checking the length of user-supplied input variables. In the preceding example, limiting the size of the variables, also using the strncpy and strncat functions instead of strcpy and strcat is also advised because strncpy and strncat limit the number of characters copied into the buffer. Preventing buffer overflows is not an insurmountable task. It is simple to avoid the unbounded string operations. 
</li>
<li> <strong>Problem: printf-Style Formatting Functions</strong>
</li>
<li>Remember that the sprintf function takes a target buffer, a format string, and one or more source arguments. The function assumes that the number of format string specifiers in the format string is the same as the number of source arguments.
</li>
<li> Recall the preceding example:
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>sprintf(target, "Name: %s, count:%d", person, num);</code> <br/>
The %s matches up with the person variables, and %d matches up with the num variable.
</p>
<ul>
<li > <strong>Problem: Integer Overflows</strong>
</li>
<li> In C integers are signed by default, meaning they can be positive or negative. Integer overflows occur when an integer value grows higher than its maximum possible value and rolls around to become a negative number.
</li>
<li> If you add 1 to an integer that is 2147483647, it overflows the maximum integer value and becomes -2147483648. If an attacker can manipulate an integer&#039;s size through user input, he may be able to overflow the value. 
</li>
<li> Here is an example. Assume that the user can manipulate len:
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="../../img/code1.png" class="media" title="code1.png"><img src="../../img/code1.png" class="media" alt="" width="300" /></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li > memcp takes an undersigned int as the length character. But before the memcpy, a bounds check is performed using signed integers. If the user can manipulate the program to pass a negative value for len, it will be possible to pass the check at [1], but in the call to memcpy at[2],len will be interpreted as a large unsigned value.</li>
<li > Here is another example in which -1 becomes 4294967295.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="../../img/code4.png" class="media" title="code4.png"><img src="../../img/code4.png" class="media" alt="" width="300" /></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li > This type of code is often found in a program receiving data from the network where length information is found at the beginning of the packet. The addition at [1], used to check that the data does not exceed the bounds of the output buffer, can be abused by setting sizel and size2 to values that cause the size variable to wrap around to a negative value.  
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong> 2. Interpreted Languages: Shell Scripting and PHP</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li >  Scripting languages such as shell scripting for UNIX or PHP for web applications make programming easier by creating rich environment where many operations happen"behind the scenes" by default.
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Scripting languages are "high-level" languages. The benefit is that many of the buffer overflow   problems that plague C/C++ are nonexistent.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Even though the most common source of buffer  overflows is C/C++ code, and scripting languages such as Perl and PHP code are less of a risk.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> UNIX and Windows shell scripts are often used as quick and easy interfaces between components when building applications.</div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> For example, when programmers need to build e-mail functions for a Web application, they often write a small UNIX shell script to call the send-mail program that is included in most UNIXes. This saves the time of writing e-mail functionality from scratch. </div>

<li class="level3"><div class="li"> <strong>Problem1: Metacharacters
</strong></div>
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Metacharacters are characters such as  ; or : that have a special meaning to the command interpreter. Other characters such as $ are expanded into a data variable that is read from the <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>.</div>

<h4 id="implementation_issues"><strong>Implementation issues</strong></h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
3. Virtual Machine Languages:
</p>
<ul>
<li > Java and C# Languages that compile into bytecode and require a virtual machine to run are typically much safer than languages that compile info native code. Java and C++ are examples of languages that are designed to be compiled into bytecode.
</li>
<li > <strong>Problem: Lack of Error Handling</strong>
</li>
<li > Java and C# use exception handling to handle errors. This is a great way to add structure to error handling.
</li>
<li > An attacker can exploit the fact that the program is in a state that the programmer did not anticipate. If the attacker can direct the program to create an exception condition at will, he may be able to get the program to execute in a path of his choosing.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4 id="native_code"><strong>Native Code</strong></h4>
<div class="level4">
<ul>
<li > Native code is code that is compiled into machine code and executed directly by 
the processor.
</li>
<li > Native code is used in many Java and C# applications. This is mostly because a large base of legacy code is written in native languages such as C, and it is much more productive to reuse the legacy code than to rewrite it all in the managed language being used.</li>
<li > If you are testing a program written in managed code, focus on the native cotit components, such as the spell-check library. These are almost always the highest risk areas of the code because of their legacy nature and because they execute out-
side the virtual machine.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>4. Platform Implementation Issues:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li > The platform is the environment that a program runs inside. It consists mainly of the operating system, but it can also include common components that a program interacts with.
</li>
<li > Programs rely on the operating system for input and output to the user, the network, and the file system. Programs also rely on the operating system to spawn and communicate with other processes. All these operations are very risky from a security standpoint. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Problem1: Symbolic Linking</strong></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Symbolic links, or symlinks, are files in a file system that point to other files. Symlinks allow administrator to move  same a file&#039;s physical location to a different device while keeping the same filename. Symlinks are available in UNIX.</div>

<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Another type of file system link is called a hardlink. A hardlink is really just additional directory entry in the fie system for file. Hardlink are available in UNIX and Windows.</div>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>Problem2: Directory Traversal</strong></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Many programs are designed to operate only on files beneath a certain point in the directory structure.</div>
</li>
<li class="level2 node"><div class="li"> Here is an example with a Web server. The Web server is configured so that the root document directory is at c:\html\. When a Web request comes in that is <a href="http://www.server.com/index.html" class="urlextern" title="http://www.server.com/index.html" rel="ugc nofollow">http://www.server.com/index.html</a>, the Web server does the following:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li">  It parses the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to remove the hostname and protocol to get the filename, index.html.</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> It prepends the document directory to the filename to get c:\html\index.html.</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> It opens c:\html\index.html, reads the contents, and sends them to the requester.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"><strong> Problem3: Character Conversions</strong></div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li">Character encodings are used to eliminate special characters or to support Unicode character sets, in Web URLs, you often notice %20 used in place of space because spaces are not allowed in URLs. </div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li">The following all represent the character string:</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
       %2f
</p>
<kbd> 
     %255c <br/>
     %c0%af <br/>

  * Similarly, a period (.)may be represented as follows:<br/>

     %2e<br/>

     %c0%ae<br/>

     %e0%80%ae<br/>

     %f0%80%80%ae<br/>

    * If an application receives input from the user, security requirements typically require that security check ensures that the input string is valid for the application's design.<br/>

    * If / is bad character, the application needs to check al the way / can be represented in order to check for it. Performing the conversion the way the platform will is called canonicalization. It means to represent the characters in their basic form.
</kbd>
<br/>
<strong>5. Generic Application Security Implementation Issues:</strong>

<ul>
<li > <strong>SQL injection</strong> is a technique that attackers can use to execute their own crafted queries on an application connected to a SQL database.
</li>
<li class="level3"><div class="li"> Consider the following example from a Java Web application:</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
      String status  = request.getParameter("status");
</p>
<pre class="code">    String description  = request.getParameter(&quot;description&quot;);
    String query  = &quot;select  * from results where status  =	+ status + 
    and description like &#039;%&quot;  + description + &quot;%&#039;&quot; ;
    String dbURL =
    &quot;jdbc:mysql://10.1 . 1.1 7/resdb?user=admin&amp;password=apple][e&quot;;
    DriverManager.registerDriver(new org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver()); 
    Connection connection= DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL);
    Statement statement= connection.createStatement();
    //	*** User input is directly supplied to this SOL query, allowing SQL
    //injection  *** 
    ResultSet result = statement.executeQuery(query);
    * To prevent SQL injection, all input should be filtered. A regular expression should be used to make sure that the input field contains only the characters you require and never the single-quote character( ).</pre>

<h4 id="cross-site_scripting">Cross-Site Scripting</h4>
<ul>
<li> Cross-site scripting takes advantage of the fact that some contexts (or Web sites) on the Internet are more trusted than others. Attackers from a nontrusted context can inject data that will be executed as script within a trusted context.
</li>
<li> An example is sending a phony e-mail to a user with a link in it. When she clicks the 
link, she goes to a Web site that is under the attacker&#039;s control. Here is an example:
<ol>
<li> Alice uses the Web site of a financial institution she trusts. The Web site requires her to enter her username and password.
</li>
<li>Eve has coded some JavaScript to retrieve the session ID of the logged-in user who runs it.
</li>
<li> Eve sends a message to Alice with the JavaScript embedded.
</li>
<li> Alice reads Eve&#039;s message. Her session ID is sent to Eve.
</li>
<li> Eve session-hijacks Alice by using her session. Eve now has access to the Web site as if she were Alice. 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="problems_during_the_development_process">Problems During the Development Process</h4>
<div class="level5">
<ul>
<li > <strong>Poorly Documented Security Requirements and Assumptions:</strong
</li>
<li > "Finding vulnerabilities is simple: discover the assumptions a developer made, and then violate those assumptions." -Eugene Spaffor
</li>
<li > Programmers cannot implement security requirements they don&#039;t know about; nor can testers test them.
</li>
<li > platform and <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> documentation provides source code examples of how to use an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> or platform service correctly Frequently programmers just copy and paste the examples into their program and modify them to suit their needs.
</li>
<li > Problems arise when the examples don&#039;t follow security best practices. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
 The problem of ignoring security in programming goes beyond platform 
providers all the way to the education process
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="poor_communication_and_documentation">Poor Communication and Documentation</h5>
<div class="level5">
<ul>
<li > Developing large software programs is arguably one of the most complex 
engineering endeavors a person can undertake. Because internal documentation is often lacking, developers need to make assumptions about how the procedures they write will be used by other developers. 
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> One of the biggest issues in creating and testing for secure programs is validating data:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Validating the size of the allowable input data by verifying the boundaries max, max 
	-i, and max+i and very large inputs.</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Validating that the data content does not allow unexpected values.</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> Validating that data is converted to its canonical representation before it is used to make a security-related decision.</div>
</li>
<li class="level4"><div class="li"> &#039;Validating that allowed inputs that are used in common attack patterns do not cause unexpected behavior in the system.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li > <strong>lack of Security Processes During the Development Process</strong>
</li>
<li > Many software security experts point to the fact that security is not considered 
throughout the entire development lifecycle as the key culprit of why so many programs today end up with so many security flaws. This is mostly because security is not taught in college computer science and software engineering programs as part of the traditional way to build software.
</li>
<li > Ignoring security issues throughout the software development lifecycle has led to 
	"reactive security". This happens when security issues are fixed only after the product has shipped to customers and a customer or security researcher discovers the problem un the field. The average security patch at Microsoft has hard costs of $100,000.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h5 id="weak_deployment">Weak Deployment</h5>
<div class="level5">
<ul>
<li > Deployment is the process of taking the software and installing and configuring it on a production system.
</li>
<li >  Developers make assumptions during development about how the software 
will be deployed. They often assume that the files and Registry keys that the software uses will be modified only by the software. File and Registry access control mechanisms need to be set properly to protect configuration files and Registry entries from tampering. </li>

<ul>
<li > Time and resources are fixed amounts in the software development process. So its very important to prioritize the test to maximize the quantity and severity of the security flaws uncovered.
<li > A technique for prioritizing security testing is threat modeling. 
</li>
<li > With threat modeling, potential security threats are hypothesized and evaluated based on an understanding of the application&#039;s design.
</li>
<li > The threats are then ranked and mitigated according to the ease of attack and the seriousness of the attack&#039;s impact.

<li > White box testing is used to discover flaws in functionality that were specified in the design and development.
</li>
<li > White box testing is the most efficient way to find security vulnerabilities.
</li>
<li > White Box Testing also gives you an accurate picture of the system&#039;s security because it doesn&#039;t rely on security by obscurity, which is the hope that attackers will never discover information about how a system works. </li>
<li > Security by obscurity is not real security.
</li>
<li > You should always assume that eventually all information about a system will be discovered or leaked.
</li>
<li > Example: A sample mitigation is the security mechanism put in place to counter the threat of inadequate randomness in a session identifier. After this mitigation is discovered through the threat-modeling process, the security tester can inspect the code that generates the session identifier. This usually is not enough because 
small mistakes that can be difficult to determine by inspecting the code can cause the randomness to be weak and vulnerable. A white box test would be to automate the process of creating a new session and to record the session identifiers that are generated. These identifiers can then be subjected to a mathematical analysis to see if they are truly random.</li>

HTTP protocol must manage its own state on top of it; this is typically done using 
cookies, small files containing name-value pairs of variables.

<li > The user requests the login page.

<li > Now that the client has a SID, it presents this SID along with every request. 
</li>
<li > This allows the server to keep track of what the client is doing, as well as authenticate the client with every request.
</li>
<li > What this means to an attacker is that if she can guess the SID, she can hijack a session that has already been authenticated. 
</li>
<li > Example: The InsecureBank.com Web site uses the user&#039;s name concatenated with the date as the user&#039;s SID. This means that if an attacker knows that a user is on the Web site, he can hijack the session by changing his SID to the user&#039;s name concatenated with the date. He does not have to authenticate himself to the system; after he has guessed the SID, he has all the rights that the legitimate user has in the application, such as withdrawing money.

<ul>
<li > Attack Pattern: Cross-Site Scripting
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li > To test for cross-site scripting, enter special <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> characters such as &lt; and &gt; into an input field of a Web application and observe whether they are returned. Or insert your attack string and view the raw <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> source of he response page that echoes the input. 
</li>
<li > If the result displayed shows the special characters unencoded, the input field may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. That is, you may see if input is transformed in any way or what else you must type to properly 
"frame" your attack string so that the Web browser accepts it.
</li>
<li > Depending on what is returned, try to get the user&#039;s cookies for the Web site to be displayed, possibly revealing the user&#039;s SID.
</li>
<li > To steal the cookie, craft a request to another server, usually an image source, which uses the cookie as part of the filename. This allows you to send the cookie to some other server under your control. 
</li>
<li > To be complete, you must test every input field of a Web site because often programmers forget to validate input on some fields and not others.
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li > Cross-site scripting attacks exploit the fact that a browser runs code, such as JavaScript or <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> &lt;OBJECT&gt; or &lt;APPLET&gt;, from an <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page in a trust context based on the Web site&#039;s <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> domain. 
</li>
<li > Because of this, any script on a page has access to the cookies for the domain that the page came from. </li>
<li > Web application vulnerabilities, however, may allow an attacker to insert crafted JavaScript into the page being returned by the Web server. 
</li>
<li > This gives the clever attacker a way to steal user cookies, which might let him hijack the user&#039;s session. 
</li>
<li > This attack is possible whenever a Web application does not properly validate user input and redisplays it to the user or other users.
</li>
<li > Testing for cross-site scripting is easy. To test for this attack, you simply enter an <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> JavaScript block into an input field of a Web application and observe whether the code was executed.
</li>
<li > This example uses a very basic cross-site scripting string as a test: &lt;script&gt;alert("XSS");&lt;/script.
</li>
<li > This simple simple JavaScript command opens an alert box that contains the string 
"XSS". 
</li>
<li > If the alert box shown in the following figure appears, the input field is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

<li > To steal the cookie, an attacker would craft a request to another server, usually an image source, which used the cookie as part of the file name.
</li>
<li > To prevent such attacks, developers must do input validation checks to ensure that no <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags or JavaScript code are allowed as input. These validation routines must be performed on the server because checks on the client can be bypassed by using a proxy.</li>
<li > Phishing Attacks : Phishing is an attack utilizing social engineering and vulnerabilities such as  cross-site to steal users&#039; identities. By sending an email with a cleverly crafted link to a site that a vulnerable to cross-site scripting, it might be possible for the attacker to steal the victims session identifier and then log in as that user.

<li class="level7"><div class="li"> Example 1: An example of bypassing authorization occurred in the restricted shell account, that ISPs used to give out to users. When users logged in, they were presented with menu of commands they could execute. Often this menu was quite restrictive and didn&#039;t allow users to perform actions such as connecting to another machine. But soon clever users discovered a loophole in such systems. One of the menu command often offered was vi (the visual editor). Once inside vi, the user could drop to a shell prompt by typing /bin /sh in vi&#039;s command mode. In this way, the user could break out of the restrictive menu offered by the ISP and perform other commands system, such as connecting to remote machines via telnet.</div>
</li>
<li class="level7"><div class="li"> Example 2: Often home page creator sets up a restricted portion of his site that requires a username and password to access. After the user enters the proper credentials, she is redirected to another set of pages, such as a photo gallery. A common error is that the only portion of the site that is actually protected by the login page is the redirection. Thus, if the user can guess the photo gallery&#039;s <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, she can view the page, bypassing the login process.</div>
