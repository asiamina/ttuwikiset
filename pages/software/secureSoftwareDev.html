<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Software is ubiquitous, even in places  you wouldn’t  imagine.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Software is so seamlessly interwoven into the fabric of modern living that it fades into the background without notice. </div>

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="how_does_software_fail_thee">How does Software Fail Thee?</h2>
<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Software is not used just by a small cross section of the modern-day  society. But, The entire population depends on Software. Airlines, banks, telecommunication companies, hospitals, supermarkets, gas stations, voting infrastructures, and countless other  institution rely on software.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> At this stage of technological innovation, we have come to realize that software must not only  function properly but also be available to us at all times and in all places so that we can continue to thrive in the digital ways of life to which we’ve grown accustomed.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> While we&#039;d like to believe that software is as reliable as it need to be, reality  proves us wrong every time. We’ll examine what makes software fragile, brittle, and resistant to reliability  and resilience, What we refer to as software resilience is an adaption of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC) definition infrastructure resilience.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li">  Software resilience  is the ability to reduce the magnitude and/or duration of disruptive  events. The effectiveness of a resilient  application  or infrastructure software depends on its ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to ,and/or rapidly recover from a potentially disruptive event.</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="vulnerabilities_abound">Vulnerabilities Abound</h3>
<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A  vulnerability, in the context of software, is a defect in the implementation that opens a pathway for an attacker with the right set of skills to exploit the defect and cause the software to behave in ways the software developer  never  anticipated.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A  vulnerability in computer security, is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system’s information assurance. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Vulnerability is the intersection of two elements:  </div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> a system susceptibility or flaw</div>

<div class="level4">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Just as software is everywhere,flaws in software are everywhere, too. Flaws in software can threaten the security and safety of the systems on which they operate. These flaws are not present just in the traditional computers, but also in critical devices that we use, such as our cellphones, cars and hospital equipments.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Example: IPhone owners can use the optional passcode lock feature of their phone to protect all the confidential documents and personal information on it. However, anyone who has obtained a protected stolen iPhone can easily by pass the lock and gain access to all the persona data on the  phone just by double clicking the home button on the phone. Apple has fixed this issue on later version of the iPhone operating system.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> In 2005,several thousand Toyota Prius cars, fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, had to recalled for safety purpose. In February 2010 the company announced a recall of 400,000  Priuses for a problem that involved that cars’ antilock brakes.According to Toyota Company, it was a software glitch. Subsequently, Toyota extended the recalls to cover millions of its vehicles, including addressing an apparent software glitch that did cause sudden acceleration.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Confidentiality is the goal of being assured that information is protected from being accessed by unauthorized users.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Integrity is concerned with implementing controls to ensure that information cannot be modified without proper authorization and that stored information cannot be tampered with. It is applicable for information at rest or when in transit.</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit9" id="testing_non-functional_requirements">Testing Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
<div class="level3">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Software testing, which focus only on functionality testing for user acceptance, can uncover errors(bugs or flaws) about how the software operates.</div>

</div>

<h4 id="manageability">Manageability</h4>
<div class="level4">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Manageability allows support personnel to move the application around available hardware as needed or run the software in virtual machine.</div>

<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Tampering: Threats in this area involve the malicious modification of data </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Repudiation: Threats in this area associated with users who deny performing an action without other parties having any way an to prove. Non-repudiation refers to the ability of  a system to counter repudiation threats.</div>
